# Network_analysis_of_traits
Here, I analyse the human trait of becoming absorbed in relation to several other traits. Complementary to factor analysis, which is the most commonly applied method used to explain the interrelationships between multiple traits, here network analysis is used to provide alternative, additional insights into the function and meaning of absorption amidst other traits. The findings contribute to the debate whether or not traits are best understood in terms of underlying latent variables or perhaps in terms of a network.

# Background
Absorption describes the susceptibility to enter psychological states that restructure or alter our everyday experience. These more or less transient states may have a dissociated character or an integrative and peak-experience-like quality. Correspondingly, they may have a “sentient” external focus, or else may reflect an inner focus on reminiscences, images, and imaginings” (Tellegen, 1992). For long, the Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS) is the most-widely used self-report questionnaire that measures this trait (Tellegen & Atkinson, 1974; Tellegen, 1981), used in a large variety of contexts, including hypnosis and music.

To examine the role and mechanisms of trait absorption, Tellegen (1992) advocated a multivariate approach by using the absorption scale together with other personality measures. Indeed, although absorption naturally varies from person to person, it often varies unmistakably as a function of other personality characteristics.

The question what the psychological construct of personality is informs on the kind of statistical model that is applicable. Traditionally, latent variables as underlying common causes for personality have been used (left figure). On the other hand, Mottus and Allerhand (2017) recently discussed in “Why Do Traits Come Together? The Underlying Trait and Network Approaches” how one’s overall identity can also be conceived as a dynamical system of interconnected personality characteristics (right figure). According to these authors, “compared with the underlying trait approach, the network approach allows for a richer way of representing associations between personality characteristics and their associations with variables outside the personality domain” (p.140).

Let’s follow this approach and adopt a network perspective to the analysis of the TAS amidst other personality traits, and compare it with the more traditional factor modeling approaches used to analyse the relations between multiple traits.

# Main Question
How does trait absorption function within a larger network of personality traits, and what are the dynamics of traits mutually affecting each other?

Note that, even if you’re not specifically interested in absorption, this is still a useful analysis because it will tell you how to apply psychometric network analysis based on summary data and shows how to compare network models with factor models. Let’s get started!
